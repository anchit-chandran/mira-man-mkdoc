# Empty types (also called Placeholder types)

An empty type has no values belonging to it (apart  from  the  undefined
value,  undef,  which  is  a  member  of  every  type).  Empty types are
declared as follows:

        widget :: type

this declares `widget` to be a type but gives it no values.

Empty types can be used during program development as  placeholders  for
types  whose  representation  is not yet decided.  For example given the
above declaration we can give type specifications involving widget, e.g.

        foo :: num->widget->widget
        gronk :: [widget]->widget

and write code using `foo' and `gronk` which can  be  checked  for  type
correctness.   At  a later stage the specification of widget as an empty
type can be replaced by a non-empty type definition using  ==,  ::=,  or
abstype, allowing foo, gronk, to be defined.

Typenames declared as empty can have any arity, eg

        table * ** :: type

This creates a family of empty types, such as `table num  bool`  and  so
on.  They are all devoid of values (apart from undef).  The general form
of this kind of specification is

        tform-list :: type
        
where `tform` consists of a typename followed by zero  or  more  generic
type  variables  (and  it  is  permitted  to  declare several such types
simultaneously, separated by commas, whence `tform-list`).

An empty type may be considered equivalent to an algebraic type with  no
constructors.
