    notes:-
    commands marked (**) are sticky, i.e. remembered for subsequent sessions
    if you don't like the resident editor choose another - recommended editors
    include - vi, joe, nano, pico, emacs - for more info see /man section 31(5)
    /recheck enables a check for update of any relevant source file before
    every evaluation, instead of only after /e[dit] - appropriate if an
    editor window is kept open alongside the mira session window.
