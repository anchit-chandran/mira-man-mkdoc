# Diagonalising list comprehensions

        [ exp // qualifiers ]

Syntax and scope rules exactly as for standard list comprehensions,  the
only difference being the use of `//` in place of the vertical bar.  The
order of enumeration of the generators is such  that  it  is  guaranteed
that  every  possible  combination of values will be reached eventually.
The diagonalisation algorithm used is "fair" in the sense that it  gives
equal priority to all of the generators.

For example the value of `[f x y//x<-[1..4]; y<-[1..4]]` is

        [ f 1 1, f 1 2, f 2 1, f 1 3, f 2 2, f 3 1, f 1 4, f 2 3,
        f 3 2, f 4 1, f 2 4, f 3 3, f 4 2, f 3 4, f 4 3, f 4 4 ]

The algorithm used used is "Cantorian  diagonalisation"  -  imagine  the
possible  combinations  of  values from the two generators laid out in a
(perhaps infinite) rectangular array, and traverse each diagonal in turn
starting  from  the origin.  The appropriate higher-dimensional analogue
of this algorithm is used for the case  of  a  list  comprehension  with
three or more generators.

As an example of an enumeration that could not be defined at all using a
standard list comprehension, because of the presence of several infinite
generators, here  is  a  definition  of  the  list  of  all  pythagorean
triangles (right-angled triangles with integer sides)

        pyths = [(a,b,c)//a,b,c<-[1..];a^2+b^2=c^2]

In the case that there is only one generator, the use of `//` instead of
`|` makes no difference to the meaning of the list comprehension.
